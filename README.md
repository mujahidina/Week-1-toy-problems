#introduction
In this file, i created 3 toy problem solutions as follows;
   

#1. Student Grade Generator.
i craeted a function that prompts the student users to input their marks and issue them their respective grades.



#2. Speed Detector.
The speed detector uses conditional statements to calculate the speed limit and output the driver's demerit points (Dmerit points more than 12 leads to lisence suspension.)



#3. Net Salary Calculator.
The net salary calculator calculates the employees' net salary after doing all the deductions and benefits.It prompts the user to input their basic salary and benefits amount.
